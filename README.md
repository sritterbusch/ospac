## Synopsis

Ospac will take a multi-channel recording of an audio podcast conversation 
and master this to  a high-quality mix-down with support for intro and outro. 

## Features

Beside other features, ospac includes a robust leveler, two solutions to
avoid crosstalk and soft silence skipping.

### Leveler

Ospac provides an energy based leveler. The following plot shows the
original on top and the levelled outcome on the bottom:

### Crosstalk Filter

This waveform shows a crosstalk from the first channel in to the second
channel, and some original content in the second half of the second channel:

The included crosstalk gate is a very robust algorithm that results in the
following:

A new experimental crosstalk filter tries to improve the result:

### Soft silence skipping

When enabled, ospac may reduce silence above 0.5s to shorter pauses:

Alternatively, ospac can try to reach target lengths (90%, 80%, 70%, 60%,
and 50%) compared to the original:

Of course, the result will only be really acceptible until all silence space is
used up.

## Examples

Mix 2 mono voice recordings with crosstalk filter, leveling and normalization:

	ospac person1.wav person2.wav --output target.wav

Mix a podcast with stereo intro and outro:

 	ospac --mix in.wav --overlap 4 \
		--voice person1.wav person2.wav --overlap 4 \
		--mix out.wav --output target.wav

## Motivation

Ospac was developed due to the need of a batch solution for audio podcast 
creation. It is a rewrite and compilation of the scripts and methods used 
for the Modellansatz podcast, http://modellansatz.de/ .

## Installation

Check that you have libsndfile and a c++-compiler on your system. 
Then, you may build and install ospac in this way:

	$ make ospac && sudo make install

On MacOS you can install libsndfile using homebrew simply by:

	$ brew install libsndfile

If you want to build the GUI, install the development packages for 
fltk-1.3 and then build ospac-gui:

	$ make ospac-gui && sudo make install-gui

Since there seem to be some broken fltk-1.3 source packages on linux, you
can alternatively try the following to build a non-statically linked
version:

	$ make ospac-gui-linux && sudo make install-gui

To simplify usage tab-completion files for bash and zsh can be generated:

	$ make tab-completion

The tab-completion is then usable by appending the following to your
`.[bash|zsh]rc` file:
	
	source PATH_TO_OSPAC/[zsh|bash]_completion.sh


## API Reference

See the doxygen docs 
https://github.com/sritterbusch/ospac/raw/master/ospac-internal.pdf
for a detailed API reference.

## Tests

You may run tests that create exemplary mixdowns and waveform images
that are used in the API documentation.

	$ make test
